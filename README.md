## Dashboard (Desktop Application)

The Dashboard does a bunch of things, including:
- Showing the picture/video stream sent by the CameraService
- Showing the altitude, the position, the speed, etc.
- Starting/Stopping a LED sequence in the drone

To run the Dashboard, first we need to install all the packages:

`npm install`

Then, we run the server:

`npm run serve`
